## Questions

1. After you turned on static website hosting, the endpoint first answered **403 Forbidden**. Why, and what changed after you added the bucket policy?
2. `testfile.txt` was still there after you moved **Backup Volume** to `instance-2`. What would have happened to a file saved on `instance-1`'s **root** volume after terminating `instance-1`?
3. Why did you run `mkfs` on `instance-1` but not on `instance-2`?
4. Why could `instance-1` and `instance-3` use the EFS file system at the same time, when an EBS volume had to be detached first? Why did they have to be in the subnets of the mount targets?
5. For each need, choose S3, EBS or EFS and give one reason: (a) a website's images, (b) the disk of a database server, (c) a folder shared by several web servers.
